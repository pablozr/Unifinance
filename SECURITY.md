# Security Guidelines for UniFinance

This document outlines security best practices for the UniFinance application.

## Environment Variables

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
- In production, use a secure secrets management system

## Authentication

- All authentication is handled through Supabase Auth
- JWT tokens are used for API authentication
- Implement proper CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Use generic error messages for authentication failures to prevent user enumeration

## API Security

- All API endpoints must validate the user's authentication token
- Implement proper input validation using Zod schemas
- Validate all URL parameters and query strings
- Implement rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Log authentication failures but avoid logging sensitive information

## Database Security

- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Never expose database credentials in client-side code
- Use prepared statements for all database queries
- Validate and sanitize all user input before storing in the database

## Frontend Security

- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Sanitize all user-generated content before rendering
- Implement proper CSRF protection for forms
- Use HttpOnly cookies for sensitive data

## Deployment

- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use a CI/CD pipeline that includes security scanning
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Conduct regular security audits

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to security@unifinance.com. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been handled by the security team.
